# Google Shopping Price Scraper

## Project Overview
I developed a Python-based web scraping tool that retrieves product prices from Google Shopping using the ScaleSERP API. This tool allows users to fetch real-time pricing information for any product and analyze the minimum, maximum, and average prices.

## Key Features
- **Automated Data Retrieval:** Uses the ScaleSERP API to fetch pricing details from Google Shopping for a specified product.
- **Customizable Search:** Supports product searches with adjustable parameters like country and location.
- **Price Analysis:** Extracts and processes price data, providing insights into pricing trends (minimum, maximum, and mean price).
- **JSON Configuration:** API key management is handled securely via a configuration file.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Requests (for API calls)
- JSON (for configuration management)
- Statistics (for price analysis)

## Use Cases
This project is ideal for e-commerce businesses, market analysts, and shoppers looking to compare product prices across multiple vendors.
